# princesselleon-aternos
public releases of parts of the server worlds of princesselleon and her friends.

## NOTE
please don't stalk my friend(s.) that's not cool. (especially don't stalk PrincessElleon!)

It's likely not possible due to missing NBT data, but if you see a sign saying it's her house - feel free to explore it in singleplayer.

Just don't stalk us to our server.

***Also: feel free to burn down leah/bella's house in-game in the singleplayer world. that glowie needs some vigalante justice. Make a sacrafice to the gods using her house - whatever.***
